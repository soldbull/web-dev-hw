# Assignment 6

## Salisha Old Bull

I've come across many post forms which allow me to login to various websites. I've also seen forms that collect information for full applications. And I've seen forms where you upload a document.

Examples of text selection include the classic one line of text to include names and addresses. They also include protected information such as passwords. Buttons can include search, upload, and submit. Buttons are used in such places as the Google search page and Moodle. Moodle asks various requests that use various buttons, depending upon the action intended.

## Work Summary

This module was complicated as I do not fully understand the URL aspect of the "action" in the form element. I'm not sure what it is supposed to be when doing a mock form.

I used the html from assignment-05 to help me through some of this assignment.

I'm also having trouble with launching the Atom application because I'm not sure how to open up a project without a weird prompt coming up during the opening. I don't know if I'm selecting the correct option, but I somehow manage to bring my files back up. I just don't think I'm doing it correctly.
