# Assignment 13

## Salisha Old Bull

## Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I learned that you do not need to recreate the wheel. But that color is very hard to work with. I also learned that the idea of inheriting code from earlier commands are hard to adjust. For instance, I cannot make change the things I want without fully understanding the concept of how to order codes correctly.

## Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
I learned that it is easiest to take images and information for a website design from free sources. However, it is also okay to use items as long as they are cited correctly or given a statement that the information is for personal use only. Otherwise, its also very acceptable to use personal images and media with the correct coding, which is can be challenging to write.

## Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I used shells from previous assignments. Then searched for new colors, images, media, and themes. I went back and watch tutorials and read my own notes to make adjustments and add items I had forgotten how to do. I frequently saved and refreshed to see how my changes were taking effect. I was careful not to add to many redundant codes because I wanted to make sure my changes were not conflicting too much with each other, which is easy to do.
