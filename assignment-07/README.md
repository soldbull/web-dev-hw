# Assignment 7

## Salisha Old Bull

## Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

The divs are elements that group items together in a box like style. Class attributes are pertaining to style, which is indicated in the head element. The id element is identifying the element being used and is good for screen reading. Span elements can be used in-line are used as a styling element.

### What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

Alt text is information that will appear when a curser is hovering over an object that has been placed; or a type of media. It is good practice to use alt attributes for screen readers.

Assignment 7 was a lot harder than the other assignments. I'm beginning to retain a little more than I was before and it is making it less difficult. I was able to go through the assignment information piece by piece and I'm beginning to have a better understanding of attributes and elements overall.
