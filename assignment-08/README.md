# Assignment 8

## Salisha Old Bull

## Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

I am trying to figure out more elements with html but I am clearly very unexperienced. I want to know more about alignment. This is quite frustrating and I wish I was better at knowing how to fix the class attribute as well as the styling classes. This has made me feel like I've taken
a step backward, but hopefully I can keep going forward.

The old information is that I'm getting better at id's. The new information is that I can't center the things I want to center because I'm not sure where to put this attribute or style.

It is very difficult!

## Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I'm excited to figure out how to work with styling and alignment better. I don't think I'm ready for much more at this point. I know we work with tables; but tables have to be the most confusing... along with forms.

## Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

After watching the walk through I felt more confident in my ability to start my assignment on my own. For the first time, I watched the walk through before I delved into the reading content. I found this much more retainable. I know if I were to continue to practice coding I could retain more over time. I definitely appreciate the weekly practice and feel frustrated that all work will stop once the semester is over. I think being able to work with html is very valuable!
