      <h1>Reason for Choosing this Instructable</h1>
    <br/>
      <h2>Why did I choose this project and what does it mean for me?</h2>
        <p>I chose this project because I value my heritage and
          value my tribal identity. I am Salish and Crow and in
          these ways, long hair is cherished. It has meanings in
          different aspects of our lives. Both males and females are
          encouraged to grow their hair long, as a sign of their
          tribal heritage and cultural values. I feel that reminding
          my children and the people in our environment that we are
          unique. In this way, long hair is acceptable and a way of life.
        </p>

      <h2>Where can you learn more?</h2>
        <p>It just so happens that this empowerment has been a mega-trend
          throughout Indian Country. You only need to search <em>boys with braids</em>
          to find more information about the pride that Indigenous people
          have in promoting their cultural heritage and their values in
          showing children to grow their hair long.</p>

        <p>My family made a Youtube video for fun and I've shown it here.
