## Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

A universal element selector is where all aspects of style will apply to the whole page. A class is designated for just one aspect of styling and can be used repeatedly throughout an html page. Any element with the designated class will have indicated styling. An id selector is used to hone in on one part of a page and can only be used one time.

## Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

I used colors of the 2000's and focused on a rose-gold combination. It is said to represent nostalgia. The colors listed are a very light pink #f6f1ee, a shade darker of pink #ebbbaa, and a gold color #fbbc93. I love this color because I use it a lot in my beadwork and I associate it with my culture.

## Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

This assignment has taken me longer than most of the other assignments. But I feel like it is helping me to grasp html index pages a little better. I like the adjustment to css pages because it is not as overwhelming. So even though it took me longer than usual, I find it easier to work with and I hope it will stick.
