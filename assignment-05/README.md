A page can only have one head and one body element.

The head contains the description and title of the page as well as meta data.

The body contains all of the content one sees on a webpage.

Structural markup is the information about the structure of the document such as headings, paragraphs, etc.

Semantic markup is used to reinforce the semantics, such as italics, emphasis, bold type etc.
