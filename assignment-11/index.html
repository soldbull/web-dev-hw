            When everyone expects you to be negative, be positive.
            <br />
            When everyone expects you to stop, speed up.
            <br />
            When everyone expects your bitter defeat, be festive.
            <br />
            When everyone is sitting it out, dance like a fool.
            <br />
            When everyone is terrified, be courageous.
            <br />
            When everyone expects destruction, start hoping.
            <br />
            When everyone is turning inward, be kind.

          Were you swimming, and is another shoe also lost?
          <br />
          Do you have a dog?
          <br />
          Do you ever secretly gnaw on the sole of your shoe? If so, might you have eaten the entire shoe?
          <br />
          Might it have disappeared down the same drain from which the bit of dental floss protruded?
          <br />
          Are you not aware that drains vary in size?
          <br />
          If, as John Lennon suggested, you can imagine there being no heaven, can you imagine that you never had the shoe?
