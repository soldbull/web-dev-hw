    <h1>About Langston Hughes</h1>
    <pre>
      According to Poetry Foundation, "Langston Hughes was a central
      figure in the Harlem REnaissance, the flowering of black
      intellectual, literary, and artistic life that took place
      in the 1920s in a number of American cities, particularly Harlem.
      A major poet, Hughes also wrote novels, short stories, essys, and plays.
      He sought to honestly portray the joys and harships of working-class
      black lives, avoiding both sentimental idealization and negative
      stereotypes."
