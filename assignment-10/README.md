## What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?

System fonts are already on your device and available for your use. But they are not always web-friendly due to licensing issues.

Web fonts are hosted on a server. They usually show up when used but they require "certain elements" to get called up.

Web-safe fonts are friendly to both PC and Macs. They are a small group that both have in common and this reduces loading time.

## What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

This is important when a device is unable to load a font, it will have a second or third option to load. Font stacks function the way media uploads function. If the fonts don't load the device knows to pull the second link or code.

## Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I'm struggling with link psuedo-classes. I couldn't get my "a:visited" to work so I didn't use it. This is frustrating because I felt like I was supposed to use the word "important." However, I remember the warning on this usage and so I just opted to take a:visited completely out. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong. Besides my general frustration I'm doing okay (very standard). There are no frills but I'm doing my best to keep moving forward.
