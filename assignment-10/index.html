      <h3><i>My voice restore for me.</i></h3>
      <h3>Navajo</h3>
      <p>Here is the wind bending the reeds westward,<br />
        The patchwork of morning on gray moraine:</p>
      <p>Had I words I could tell of origin,<br />
        Of God's hands bloody with birth at first light,<br />
        Of my think squeals in the heat of his breath,<br />
        Of the taste of being, the bitterness,<br />
        And scents of camas root and chokecherries.
      </p>
      <p>And, God, if my mute heart expresses me,<br />
        I am the rolling thunder and the bursts<br />
        Of torrents upon rock, the whispering<br />
        Of old leaves, the silence of deep canyons.<br />
        I am the rattle of mortality.
      </p>
      <p>I could tell of the splintered sun. I could<br />
        Articulate the night sky, had I words.
      </p>
